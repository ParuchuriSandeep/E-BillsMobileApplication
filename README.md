The proposed solution is to generate electronic bills in the retailerâ€™s computer instead of printing the paper bill. 
This electronic bill generated in the computer is saved to the firebase that is connected to our app. And there is another option to send the mail of the bill produced to the customer through gmail or google drive. 
All the bill generated in the shop are saved in the firebase including the customers details.
