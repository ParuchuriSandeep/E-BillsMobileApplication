These days, everything are electronic then why paper bills? The main aim of this project is to generate electronic bills instead of paper bills (This also reduces the wastage/usage of paper). The e-bill generated can also be sent to the customer’s mail for further reference and also stored in firebase for the shop’s reference.

The proposed solution is to generate electronic bills in the retailer’s computer instead of printing the paper bill. 
This electronic bill generated in the computer is saved to the firebase that is connected to our app. And there is another option to send the mail of the bill produced to the customer through gmail or google drive. 
All the bill generated in the shop are saved in the firebase including the customers details.
